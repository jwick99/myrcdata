<h1>Repairs</h1>
    <p>When the repairs option is chosen, users are presented with a list of all planes currently in repair.
      Optionally, you can select repair history for a list of all previously completed repairs
  </P>
    <p>
    Selecting a plane in repair will present the user with the repair record.   
      This record can be updated for status on interim repairs, or marked as completed.
      When completed the plane is returned to "ready to fly" status and the record is closed.
